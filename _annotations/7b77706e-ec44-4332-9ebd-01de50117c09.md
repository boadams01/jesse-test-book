Antichrist: The beast was captured along with the false prophet, who had performed signs on its behalf. With these he deceived those who received his sign and worshipped his image; they have sunk into the depth of the fire and sulphur and are killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the white horse. Revelation 19. Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and overthrow by the glory of his coming. 2 Thessalonians 2.
