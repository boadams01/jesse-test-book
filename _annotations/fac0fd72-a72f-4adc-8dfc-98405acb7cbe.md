Christ: If I then, who is your lord and master, have washed your feet, so even more should you wash one anotherâ€™s feet. With this I have given you a demonstration and example that from now on you should also do as I have done to him. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his master; nor also is the dispatched messenger greater than he who sent him. Do you know this? Blessed are you if you will do this. John 13.
