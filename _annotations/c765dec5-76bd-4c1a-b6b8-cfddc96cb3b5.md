We order and decree that it shall not be appropriate for those who hold secular jurisdiction to impose taxes and contributions on clerical persons or to demand this from their houses and all other goods, on the pain of the ban and interdict. Equally the clergy should not pay all this without our permission. c. i. de immunit. eccle. li. vi. In this way the pope has torn up Godâ€™s laws by his laws, which is the sole work of his unchristian decretals.
