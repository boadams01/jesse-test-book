In perhaps the most scathing indictment of papal militancy and arrogance, the pope with his triple-crowned tiara is shown coming out of his palace on an elaborately ornamented horse; as usual, he is accompanied by his entire entourage of cardinals and bishops, who also ride.  They are all led by a pair of contemporary, armed foot soldiers with halberds, who turn a corner to reveal an ultimate destination of the pit of Hell, where tormented souls writhe among flames beneath hovering demons.  Even the papal texts are scathing choices, emphasizing the kingly claims of a worldly Vatican: "The clergy are all kings, and the crown has been appointed to their head.  The pope may ride equal to the emperor."
