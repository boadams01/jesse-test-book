While they watched  he was taken up, and the clouds took him out of their sight. This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come again in the same way as you have seen him go into heaven. Acts 1. His kingdom has no end. Luke 1. Whoever serves me, will follow me; and where I am, there my servant will also be. John 12.
