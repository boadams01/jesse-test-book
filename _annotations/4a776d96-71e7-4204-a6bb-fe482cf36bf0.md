Here sits the Antichrist in the temple of God and presents himself as God, as Paul foretells. 2 Thessalonians 2. He alters all the divine order, as Daniel says, and suppresses holy scripture, sells dispensations, indulgences, cloaks, bishoprics, benefices. He raises up the treasures of the earth, dissolves marriages, burdens consciences with his rules, makes legislation and tears it up again for money. He raises saints, blesses and curses unto the fourth generation, and orders his voice to be heard just like Godâ€™s voice. c. sic omnis. dist. 19.  And no one should argue against him. 17. 9. 4. c. Nemini.
