Rather than living among the poor, the counter image shows the pope watching a jousting tournament, far above the chaos of knights and horses. Wealthy women, trumpeters, and clergy join the pope in the upper level. The first text describing the image quotes canon law approving the elevated status of the papacy over the common people.

In the bottom right, a court jester announces the spectacle. This emphasizes the second half of the text, which describes a stereotype of Germans as fools who need to be ruled strictly because of their ignorance. This panel therefore shows how the early Reformation tapped into widespread German discontent with foreign rulers like the popes.
