The kingdom of the Antichrist is wholly of outward nature. For what else does canon law speak of except chasubles, vestments, tonsures, feast days, consecrations, benefices, sects, monks and priests? And they call their possessions and goods spiritual good, they call themselves alone the Christian Church, they call the priests the chosen people of God, as if the laity were not in the church and of God, contrary to all scripture. Additionally, he prohibits meals and marriage, as Paul predicted: “There will come seducing spirits and forbid such things.” 1 Timothy 4.
