It often happens that the bishops are burdened with many affairs, and, on account of their feuds, sometimes they also cannot provide preaching which should not be the case. Especially when their dioceses are large, then they may commission others to preach on their behalf. c. Inter cetera de offi. ordina. These are the bishops who forget their proper office, have become true animals of the belly and say: “Come let us drink and feast and so live well the whole time.” Isaiah 56.
