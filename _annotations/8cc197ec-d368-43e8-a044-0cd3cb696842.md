He found in the temple those selling sheep, oxen and doves and money changers sitting. And he soon made a whip out of cords and drove out all the sheep, oxen, doves and changers from the temple. He scattered the money, overturned the counting tables and to those selling the doves he said: “Take these away. Do not make a market hall out of my father’s house.” John 2. Freely you have received; therefore freely give. Matthew 10. May your money be with you in damnation. Acts 8.
