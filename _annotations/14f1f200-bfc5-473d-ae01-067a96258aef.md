Christ: Go to the sea and cast your hook. Open the mouth of the first fish which comes up. You will find a guilder inside, pay the toll with it for me and you. Matthew 17. Render authority which wields the sword in its hands its dues; interest to him who is owed interest; the toll to him to whom it is due. Paul to the Romans 13.
