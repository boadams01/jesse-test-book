We abrogate all oaths which the clerics have sworn in captivity and order that their goods should be protected not only by the spiritual but also by the worldly sword, until they have their former goods once again. 15. q. 6. c. Auctoritatem.  And whoever dies or perishes in this war will attain eternal life. 23. q. 5. c. Omnium   et q. 8. c. Omni.  This means to be so sure of one's possessions that one regards them as good even though Christian blood is spilled over them.
