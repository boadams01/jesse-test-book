This image of the pope opposite Jesus's efforts negates that very effort, since the pontif is shown in an elaborate litter, carried by an entourage of six prelates within his expansive palace.  His palanquin is shaded and adorned with another elaborate brocade, and his heraldic coat of arms with the crossed keys of St Peter appears beside the arched doorway that is his destination.  Rather than bearing the cross as a lone individual, the pope instead is borne on the backs of his subjects, and instead of a spiritual retreat to mountain or forest, he seeks seclusion in his papal palace.  The German text, citing the Latin chapter, si quis suadente and related texts, ironically proclaims how the pope takes up the cross unwillingly by putting his hand on the priest, cursing, and giving him the Devil.
