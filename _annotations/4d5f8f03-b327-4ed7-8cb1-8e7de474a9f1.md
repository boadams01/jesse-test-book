The grandeur of the church, palace, and walls of the opposite panel stand in contrast to the manger scene and the poverty of Christ. Furthermore, such imposing buildings are being guarded by an army and the nobility, who have spears, swords, horses, and a canon. The text describes the right of the church to use armed force to take the possessions—and even the lives—of those who oppose the church. This is therefore a powerful Protestant statement against the social, political, and military violence employed by the papacy to maintain and enforce its might.
