This aspiration to worldly power and authority is visible in the contrasting panel. Instead of casting purses and cloaks at Jesusâ€™ feet, the pope and his colleagues are splendidly dressed (one bishop in the front prominently wears a purse) as they set their sights upon the tower at the top of the hill. The corresponding text cites canons about honoring bishops and about sparing no expense when it comes to church consecrations.
