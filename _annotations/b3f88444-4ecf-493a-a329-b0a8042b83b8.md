If not every pamphlet can be called libellous, unless it contains within it libellous vices and misdeeds, so it is clear that this little book cannot be considered libellous nor be prohibited in the laws which have gone out against libellous writings. Since everything which is in it can be found in papal canon law, not simply as something tolerable, but rather as laws. And in particular it has been published solely to show the basis of spiritual and temporal law as a summary and in brief, conducive to the general benefit of Christianity.
Consider it therefore good,
There will soon be better ones.
