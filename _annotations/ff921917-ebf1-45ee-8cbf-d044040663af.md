Jesus refused to become a worldly king or ruler. In the story pictured here, Jesus escaped a crowd that wanted to “take him by force and make him king” after they experienced the miraculous feeding of five thousand people who had come to hear him speak (John 6:15). Another reference to the Gospel of John in the text accompanying this image comes from Jesus’ trial before the Roman governor of Judea, a man named Pontius Pilate. Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus replied, “My kingdom is not of this world” (John 18:33-37).
