In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, Jesus’ last supper with his disciples revolves around the institution of a ritual meal for the forgiveness of sins, in which Jesus says of bread “this is my body” and of the cup “this is my blood” (Matthew 26:26, et al.). Christians often call this the Eucharist, the Sacrament of Holy Communion, or the Lord’s Supper. 

The Gospel of John, however, focuses on Jesus’ action after the meal, when he took the role of servant to wash his disciples’ feet. Going beyond the biblical text, the image shows Jesus not just washing but kissing the foot of a disciple, presumably Peter, who had objected to his master’s lowly act of humility. With Peter scratching his head and the other disciples exchanging confused glances, the artist aptly captures their surprise. Jesus, however, continued to teach through this act of humble service, saying, “If I then, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that you should also do just as I have done to you” (John 13:14-15).
