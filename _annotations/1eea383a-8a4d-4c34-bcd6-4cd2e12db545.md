Even compared to his earlier self-indulgent pleasures, this image of the pope's court presents of his most luxurious activities.  Seated in a large chamber under another baldachin and wearing his tiara, he gorges himself on food and drink as still more dishes are brought forth from the kitchen for him and his clerical guests at table. All of the trappings of aristocratic feasting accompany his meal: in the upper left a fool stands ready to provide entertainment, while in the immediate foreground a costumed group of musicians make music with lute, harp, and trombone, while a pair of well-dressed men with contemporary hats occupy the right corner ([Normore 2015](#zotero-RUZ688YP)).
