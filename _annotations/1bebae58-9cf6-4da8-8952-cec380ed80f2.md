Christ: When Jesus became aware that they were going to come and make him king, he escaped again to a mountain, he alone. John 6. My kingdom is not of this world. John 18. The kings of the world rule over them and those who hold power are called gracious lords. Yet you shall not be so, but he who is greater among you shall humble himself as the lesser. Luke 22.
