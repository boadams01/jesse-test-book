Rather than the riches that one might expect as the counterpoint to Christ's poverty on earth, this woodcut instead features the unseemly aggressive warrior element of the papacy.  A fully contemporary German version of the military appears here in armor, with the full panoply of weapons: pikes and cannon as well as the traditional knightly cavalry.  There is no visible marker of the pope himself, though a crowned commander figure in the lower left foreground wears a crown as he holds a halberd.  In the background stands a massive castle compound, presumably to be put under siege for further conquest.  If the papacy is to be identified here as the instigator of such inappropriate warfare for territorial gain, it stands guilty of worldly pride and avarice, defying the life and teaching of the Prince of Peace. The accompanying chosen texts appropriately emphasize righteous war and protection of property.
