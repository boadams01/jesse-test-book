Content – Sources – Reception

Ulrich Bubenheimer

1. Structure and Content

In the year 1521 a juxtaposition of Christ and Antichrist, i.e. Christ and the Pope, was produced in the form of an image-text combination that was published anonymously in Latin as well as in German -- _Antithesis figurata vitae Christi et Antichristi_ und _Passional Christi und Antichristi_. None of the contributors to this production –creators of the images, artists, authors of the texts and publishers—revealed their names. In the Wittenberg version, the polemic satire consists of 13 antitheses (numbered here in Roman numerals I-XIII), each depicted in woodcut images. Below each of the total 26 woodcuts (numbered here in Arabic numberals 1-26) is a printed commentary consisting of several lines.

Below is a summary of the image sequence and of the themes depicted in the woodcuts (table 1). With the theme of each individual image I list the sources—Bible and Canon Law—cited in the printed text. Since the individual woodcuts often refer to several biblical passages, I have marked in bold the relevant scene from the life of Christ or in two cases also the Antichrist scene.

Looking at the relation between the illustrations and the sources cited in the text, the following image emerges: only one of the Christ-motifs—Christ is born in a stable (VIII 15)—is not based on one of the cited Bible passages. The motifs for the Antichrist/Pope-scenes are chosed so that they serve as a foil to the corresponding Christ-scenes. In four instances, the Antichrist images are paired with Bible passages (I 2; III 6; XII 24; XIII 26). In these citations, either warnings of false prophets are applied to the Pope (1 Pet. 2:1,10 in I 2) or figures in the book of Revelation are identified as the Pope. Apocalyptic motifs from the Bible have also influenced the depiction of the final two Pope-images (XI 24; XIII 26). However, the texts accompanying the Pope-images do not focus on biblical passages, but rather on the sources of Canon Law, in particular the _Decretum Gratiani_ and the papal decretals. The juxtapisition of biblical texts with Canon Law represents in itself an antithesis: Bible vs. Canon Law. The influence of the legal source texts on the illustrations requires further research. ##[to be continued]

1. Latin _Antithesis_ and German _Passional_

Martin Luther (1483-1546) first mentions the idea of an &quot;antithesis in images&quot; in a letter on March 7, 1521 to his friend Georg Spalatin (1484-1545), secretary to the Elector Frederick the Wise (1463-1525): _Iam paratur Antithesis figurata Christi (et) pap(a)e, bonus pro laicis liber_.
# 6
 (&quot;At the moment an antithesis in images of Christ and the Pope is being prepared, a good work the laity.&quot;). The expression chosen here by Luther for the work that is being prepared—_Antithesis figurata Christi et papae_—is so close to the Latin title of the work—_Antithesis figurata vitae Christi et Antichristi_—that it may suggest that the version with Latin texts may have been the original, followed next by a translation of the texts for a German edition. To settle this question, a complete comparison of the Latin text version (_Antithesis figurata_) with the German (_Passional_) was conducted. For the comparison, the following Wittenberg printings were used:

ANTITHESIS FIGVRATA VITAE | CHRISTI ET ANTHICHRISTI. | AD LECTOREM | Eusebius. || Qua[m] male co[n]ueniant cum Christi pectore Iesu: | […]. [Wittenberg: Johann Grunenberg, 1521].
# 7

Passional Christi vnd | Antichristi. [Wittenberg: Johann Grunenberg, 1521].
# 8

A comparison of the two confirmed that the Geman text is a translation of the Latin. There are occasional remainders of Latin expressions in the German text, which would not have been understood by laypeople with knowledge of Latin. The most notable example is as follows: On the tenth antithesis (woodcut 19: Christ demands poverty, Matt. 10:10-11) the _Antithesis figurata_ reads:

S. Petrus dixit: Aurum et argumentum non habeo. Actuum. iij. Vbi est ergo patrimonium Petri?
# 9

The Wittenberg printing of the _Passional_ has:

Sanct Peter sagt/ Ich habe wyder golt nach silber act. 3.
# 10
 Vbi ist dan Patrimonium Petri?&quot;
# 11

The mixture of German and Latin in the second sentence is a clear indication that the translator was working with the text of the _Antithesis figurata_. While the version of the translation cited here was kept in all Wittenberg and Erfurt reprints, only the Strasbourg imprints, which generally offer an edited and expanded version of the pamphlet, have corrected this linguistic error:

Sant Peter sagt. Ich hab weder goldt noch silber. Act.3. Wa ist dann Patrimonium vnd erbgu(o)t
# 12
 Petri.
# 13

The confirmation of the priority of the Latin version of the pamphlet shows that the expression _Passional_ was not used in the original form, but that the image sequence was referred to as &quot;Antithesis in images from the life of Christ and of the Antichrist.&quot; In fact, the selected scenes are by no means taken only from the biblical tradition of the Passion of Christ, but present a sequence of scenes from the life of Jesus or Christ, of which some, according to iconographic tradition,
# 14
 naturally relate to the Passion of Christ. The larger thematic scope, which is not limited to the Passion story, is explained by the objective of the image sequence, a juxtaposition of the actions of Christ with the actions of the Antichrist. This presupposed an identification of the Antichrist with the Pope, as Luther wrote in his letter on March 7, 1521 to Spalatin of a planned &quot;antithesis in images of Christ and the Pope.&quot;
# 15

1. Tradition History

The scenes depicted in the _Passional_ tie into an existing tradition and prompt at the same time a new process of tradition. The images and texts of the Latin as well as the German version must be placed within this stream of tradition. The question of the tradition history must therefore be twofold: 1. Which traditions did the Wittenberg contributors—the creators and developers of the images and the authors of the texts? 2. How was the Wittenberg production received and continued in light of later printings and of marks of provenance left by readers on the printed works?

1. The Copy of the _Passional_ in the Pitts Theology Library

The copy of the _Passional_ held by the Pitts Theology Library, printed in Erfurt by Matthäus Maler,
# 16
 has the highest number of manuscript notes of all copies I have examined so far. The engagement of the anonymous reader with the work is first reflected in the rudimentary colorization of the woodcuts. While the inscriber used an ink that appears grey today
# 17
 he used a brown ink for the colorization, which can be seen already on the title page in a ornamentation within the title border.
# 18
 This poses the question wheter the colorizations of the woodcuts go beyond the intent of ornamentation. ### [to be continued] ###

The verbal remarks of the reader are summarized in the overview below.

This is true for fools: Ruling sternly over the German fools.
 [Quoted from the printed text.] |
| XI 22C4r | [7] Der Bapst lest sich Beten an/ in seinem abgöttischn Cram/ da er ist selber die war. | Der Papst lässt sich anbeten in seinem abgöttischen Kram, in dem er selbst die Ware ist. | The pope lets himself be worshipped in his idolatrous junk shop, where he himself is merchandise. |

The nine annotations in the printed pamphlet consist of a supplement to a Bible passage with one of the Christ scenes (Nr. 3), an emphasis by repetition in the margin of a text passage for a Pope image (Nr. 6) and seven commentary notes for a total of five Pope images. Woodcut V. 9 shows Christ associating with the lame, crippled, blind and leprous, which is seen as a sign of his humility according to the text in Phil. 2:6-8. Although the image does not depict a healing, the inscriber refers to Mt. 11:5 in the margins with the Latin heading 6 Opera Christi (&quot;6 works of Christ&quot;): &quot;The blind see, the lame walk, the mute speak, the deaf hear, the lepers [are] clean, the dead rise and the Gospel is preached to the poor.&quot; The picture prompted the reader to note a biblical association that went beyond the image-text arrangement. The authors of the _Passional_ could forgo mentioning the healing miracles, since they intended to use this antitheses to contrast the humility of Christ with the pride of the Pope, who is enjoying a rough knights tournament in the company of courtiers, musicians and women. However, our inscriber understood the tournament scene differently. He interprets the fight of the tournament competitors as knights fighting for the Papacy--&quot;These are fighting for the Papacy. The Papacy shall pass.&quot;—and cheers on the fighters—&quot;Fight on, good Sirs, fight, and break the Papacy.&quot; The German inscriber also links the fight against the Papacy to nationalist sentiments against the religious leaders in Rome. In strong letters he repeats in the margins what the author of the printed text wrote in reference to gloss about the Gratian decretum: „This is true for fools: Ruling sternly over the German fools.&quot; The Pope- Antichrist, who lets himself be worshipped and can be bought for money (notes 7 and 8) is bound to end up in Hell, according to the _Passional_ (XIII 26), which is echoed ironically by the inscriber: „The Pope learns to fly to the devil by God&#39;s command.&quot; (Nr. 9).

Remarkable is the oscene language in two of the notes (Nr. 1 and 2) on the coronation of the Pope (Image II 4). The inscriber calls out to the bishops who perform the crowning: &quot;Place the crown on the Pope&#39;s head, then cut off his testicles&quot; and he tells another bishop and two monks who are attending the coronation &quot;Bishop and monks, look up into his [the Pope&#39;s] backside.&quot; This style corresponds to the &quot;fecal-erotic&quot; polemic
# 20
 that Luther exhibist in his tract

_Wider das Papsttum zu Rom vom Teufel gestiftet_ (&quot;Against the Papacy in Rome, founded by the Devil, 1545). This observation may suggest that

Our inscriber only entered his notes in the printed work in the 1530s or 40s, when the hardening of denominational divisions brought with it a brutalization of religious polemic. A definitive _terminus post quem_ for the inscriptions by our annotator is the publication of Luther&#39;s translation of the New Testament in September 1522, since the inscriber&#39;s citation of Mt. 11:5 is dependent on Luther&#39;s translation. ## to be continued ##
